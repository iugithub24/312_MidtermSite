Summary


Wireframes
I used wireframes in the construction of the recopies overview page as well as each recipe page. Using the same layout, I built all three 
recipe pages with similar colors and containers. Having a structured template helped me to create subsequent pages with more ease.

Flexbox

Flexbox was used in nearly every aspect of this assignment. The newly created week page, as well as the various recipe pages, were all 
constructed using flex containers. These containers are named Ôwrapper1..2..3Õ. Within these containers, IÕve used techniques such as 
flex-direction, align-items, and justify-content to manipulate the elements. This made it easier to center items and provide a more consistent look.

Cards

Cards were utilized on the ÔweekÕ page. I wanted to present the recipe choices artistically. Thus, I chose to present them via flip cards. This way 
the user can see the recipe and view the title on the back before clicking on it. Not to mention it adds a sense of style to the page.

Media Queries

I used quite a lot of media queries within this project. These can be found on almost every page. A majority of them are found in the individual recipe 
pages. They are used to change many different factors such as margin, positioning of elements, size of images, and even the size of the fonts. All this 
was done to make my site mobile-friendly and responsive. Of course, you can also find the media query relating to the navbar on every page.

Hamburger Menu

I used my previous design for a navbar and copied the markup and styling into all the pages. Since all the pages had the same nav, I condensed everything 
into one nav.css file and linked it to all the pages. As opposed to having the same redundant code in each stylesheet. This feature allows the user to access 
any of the pages no matter the screen size.

Less Preprocessor

For my individual recipe pages, I used a less stylesheet. Within each of these files, I added a variable for my favorite font I would use throughout the document. 
I also created a few classes for my titles and ingredient li tags. The most obvious feature that you can see within each less file is the extensive use of nesting. 
It allowed me to keep things structured and organized. Finally, to achieve the exact color I wanted for the body, I used the ÔlightenÕ function. In conclusion, 
all of these features aided me in creating a cleaner stylesheet that can be easily read.

Form Controls

My use of form controls can be seen on the ÔweekÕ page. Knowing that some of these recipes might be difficult to grasp, some individuals might want to download them 
onto their own devices for studying or future reference. ThatÕs why I added a select field to choose which of the recipes you want to download. ItÕs limited to one 
so you can download them one at a time. The select field also looked the most aesthetic within the webpage.
